This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project focused on predicting occupancy status in buildings using environmental data such as temperature, humidity, light, and CO2 levels. The project applies machine learning techniques including k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classification, hypothesis testing, and data normalization to classify whether a building is occupied or not.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to analyze and predict building occupancy using various environmental factors. The notebook demonstrates the following:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for machine learning tasks.

Hypothesis Testing: Using t-tests to evaluate the significance of various environmental features (e.g., temperature, light, CO2) on occupancy.

k-NN Classification: Implementing the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict occupancy status.

Cross-validation: Selecting the optimal hyperparameters for the k-NN model through cross-validation.

Data Normalization: Applying data normalization to improve model performance.

Getting Started
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you will need to set up a Python environment with the required dependencies.

Prerequisites
You will need the following Python packages:

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

scipy

Running the Notebook
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
Navigate into the project folder:

cd repository-name
Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Open the Jieyu.Lian.2.ipynb notebook and follow the steps to run the analysis.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains environmental data for building occupancy prediction. It includes the following features:

Temperature (Celsius)

Relative Humidity (%)

Light (lux)

CO2 (ppm)

Occupancy (Class label: 0 = Not Occupied, 1 = Occupied)

The data is available in CSV files: OccupancyTrain.csv and OccupancyTest.csv.

Results
Hypothesis Testing: Evaluated the impact of environmental factors on occupancy using t-tests.

k-NN Classification: Achieved a classification model with high accuracy after cross-validation.

Data Normalization: Improved the model's performance by standardizing input features.

Conclusion
